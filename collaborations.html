<h3>So, you're looking to do a collaboration?</h3>

<p>Maybe! Please read the guidelines below to find out if your channel is suitable.</p>

<div align="left">
<h1>Requirements for potential collaborators</h1>
<hr>
</div>

<div align="justify">
<h2>General</h2>

<p>Please note that all collaborations are reviewed manually, and are only subject to instant rejection if there is a high volume of requests. This is to ensure that the quality of Kaihatsu content is upheld. Although Kaihatsu is a small channel, accepting every request for a collaboration will result in a negative feedback loop where less viewers engage with videos, which makes the algorithm push the channel's videos less. All declined requests will be given a reason why, so that your content may be improved upon. </p>

<p> While there is no limit on the amount of times you can apply, we reccomend that you wait at least 6 months before re-requesting, in order to give yourself time to improve the quality of your videos.</p>
	
<hr>

<h2>Suitable channels</h2>

<b>In order to be considered eligible for consideration, the channel considering requesting to collaborate MUST at least have 1/3 (30%) the number of Kaihatsu subscribers, at the moment that is give or take 300 subscribers. Channels below this limit will NOT be considered regardless of the other requirements.</b>	
	
<p>Although exceptions are (very rarely) made, below is a list of what channels will NOT be accepted for a collaboration:
</p>
	
<ul>
<li>
Let's Play channels (although this restriction does not apply for channels with over 50,000 subscribers). <small>So <i>NO,</i> your Minecraft Let's Play channel with 20 subscribers won't be eligible.</small>	
</li>	
	
<li>
Channels that only cover the following games: Undertale, the Five Nights at Freddy's series, Doki Doki Literature Club or Bendy and the Ink Machine.	
</li>
	
<li>
Channels that violate YouTube's community guidelines and/or Terms of Service. 
</li>

<p>Please note that channels may also be refused based on association as well as reputation and current standing within the wider YouTube community.
</p>

<h2>Age Requirements</h2>

<p>While this may be an odd requirement to some, I have repeatedly been asked by young fans to make collaboration videos with them, so here are some requirements regarding age:
</p>
	<div align="center">
<p><b>You WILL NOT be considered at all for a collaboration if you are below the age of 16.</b></p>
	</div>
	
<p>There are several reasons for this, one of the most important ones being maturity. It is important that collaborators on both sides are mature people who can work well with others. One other important aspect is voice. Older, lower voices are much more appealing to audiences online... that's that, and that can't be changed.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, since the dawn of the internet there has always been an intense hatred for younger users, and on YouTube, that hatred is very much vocalised. Users will relentlessly dislike the videos of younger people purely because of their age, as well as their voice, and how 'cringey' they are. This makes it difficult to work with younger users. </p>
<p>One more point (although this is my own personal opinion here): I never started making videos until I was 13, and even then I just messed around. If you're young and you're looking to do YouTube as a hobby, that's fine! Just don't let it consume you and take over your life at such a young age - go make friends and do stuff outside. I know it's easy to disregard this advice but socialising in person <i>should</i> take priority over trying to make a video with someone you've never met over the internet.

<h2>Video quality</h2>

<p>This is only applicable to those looking to edit a video for their own channel if Kaihatsu is being featured on their own channel.
</p>
		
<p>Applicants MUST have video and editing quality simillar to that in 'The Science Behind Super Mario Sunshine' (https://youtu.be/cZRMHv8k7qA). This is the minimum editing ability standard, and anything below this will not be accepted.
	
<p>Applicants must also be capable of uploading in HD 1080p60. 
<hr>

<h2>Audio quality</h2>

<p>Audio quality must be of a very high standard, and should be of a similar quality to the voiceovers in current Kaihatsu videos.</p>
<p>For reference, I use an Audiotechnica AT2020USB+ condenser microphone. However, BlueYeti micrphones are also of a high standard.</p>
<hr>

<h2>As an online personality</h2>

<p>My primary aim is to make videos for others to enjoy. Anyone considering asking to do a collaborative video should ask themselves the following questions:</p>
<li>
Is my primary aim to make videos for others to enjoy and be educated by?<br/><br/>
</li>
		
<li>
Is monetary gain an irrelevant factor to my creative output? (Obviously if you are a full time content creator this question can be ignored)<br/><br/>
</li>
		
<li>
Am I to as truthful and transparent as I can be with my audience? Do I strive to be more truthful and transparent with them?<br/><br/>
</li>

<li>
Do I strive to make my videos as informative and accurate as possible?<br/><br/>
</li>
<hr>

<h2>What happened to The Science Behind?</h2>

<p>Well recently I've been tied down with Nostalgia Trip, and at the moment that is my priority. I've been experimenting with the Science Behind so that I can make shorter videos and get them out more frequently.</p>
<p>To be honest, I prefer to make videos about culture and art so sometimes it can be difficult to get myself to write about a topic that I'm not interested in or familiar with - this is why Science Behind episodes have been so infrequent. I'm still going to work on the series but there have been a couple times already where I've got close to cancelling it, so don't be surprised if in the future I just amalgamate it with my theory series.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Are you a COMMUNIST?</h2>

<p>Haha, no. I get this all the time because of Marxist March, but no, I am not remotely communist.</p>
<hr>

<h2>What is that blob thing in your videos?</h2>

<p>I honestly don't know... I tried asking it but it won't tell me.</p>
