<h3>So, you're looking to do a collaboration?</h3>

<p>Maybe! Please read the guidelines below to find out if your channel is suitable.</p>

<h1>Guidelines/requirements for potential collaborators</h1>
<hr>
<h2>General</h2>

<p>Please note that all collaborations are reviewed manually, and are only subject to instant rejection if there is a high volume of requests. This is to ensure that the quality of Kaihatsu content is upheld. Although Kaihatsu is a small channel, accepting every request for a collaboration will result in a negative feedback loop where less viewers engage with videos, which makes the algorithym push the channel's videos less. All declined requests will be given a reason why, so that your content may be improved upon. </p>

<p> While there is no limit on the amount of times you can apply, we reccomend that you wait at least 6 months before re-requesting, in order to give yourself time to improve the quality of your videos.</p>

<h2>How can I get started on YouTube/grow my channel?</h2>

<p>All I did at the start was invest in some decent editing software and put lots of relevant tags in my videos. I also shared a lot of my videos on Reddit. However, one inconvenient truth that people don't like to hear about YouTube is that nowadays, with so many channels competing to cover the same topics, you do need to have good audio and video/editing quality to attract people to your channel. Polish isn't everything, but it keeps people coming back.

<h2>What programs do you use to make videos?</h2>

<p>I use the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, but the main programs I use from that are Photoshop (image editing), Premiere (video editing), After Effects (special effects) and Audition (sound recording). I also use effects suites from Red Giant and some other companies to make my videos look a bit more stylised sometimes.

<h2>What microphone/other equipment do you use?</h2>

<p>My microphone is an Audio Technica AT2020USB+ microphone. I also use a microphone stand. For graphics editing I use a Wacom Intuous Pro drawing tablet. My computer is custom built.

<h2>Could you help me edit/make a video?</h2>

<p>Sorry! I'd love to help out but I'm far too busy to do things like that right now. I might give editing lessons in the future if I have spare time though.</p>
<hr>

<h2>I make videos! Could we work together?</h2>

<p>Maybe! I'm always looking to work with other like minded and talented people. Send an email to business[at]kaihatsusha[dot]com and I'll get back to you.</p>
<p><i><small>Please bear in mind that I can only really consider working with you if you have decent audio and video/editing quality, similar in quality to that found in 'The Science Behind Super Mario Sunshine'. Small channels should also have at least 300 subscribers (around 30% of my subscriber base).</small></i><p>

<h2>What happened to The Science Behind?</h2>

<p>Well recently I've been tied down with Nostalgia Trip, and at the moment that is my priority. I've been experimenting with the Science Behind so that I can make shorter videos and get them out more frequently.</p>
<p>To be honest, I prefer to make videos about culture and art so sometimes it can be difficult to get myself to write about a topic that I'm not interested in or familiar with - this is why Science Behind episodes have been so infrequent. I'm still going to work on the series but there have been a couple times already where I've got close to cancelling it, so don't be surprised if in the future I just amalgamate it with my theory series.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Are you a COMMUNIST?</h2>

<p>Haha, no. I get this all the time because of Marxist March, but no, I am not remotely communist.</p>
<hr>

<h2>What is that blob thing in your videos?</h2>

<p>I honestly don't know... I tried asking it but it won't tell me.</p>
