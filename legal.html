<h2>Fair use and usage of copyrighted works in videos.</h2>
<p>
	All content on this website is property of Kaihatsu.
	All material used, which Kaihatsu does NOT hold the rights to, has been used in good faith that it falls under US fair use copyright law, Fair Dealing in Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 in the United Kingdom, The EU Copyright Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society), and the Japan copyright act (著作権法).
	All videos fall under these laws, as they are transformative in nature, use no more of the original works than necessary, and have no negative effects on the market for the original works.
	Furthermore, these videos are protected speech as outlined by the first amendment of the United States Constitution, freedom of expression as outlined in British Common Law and Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and Article 21 of the Japanese Constitution (第二十一条、日本国憲法).

<h2>User Privacy.</h2>
<p>
	Following the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), websites are required to outline what data is collected from users and why.

	<li>
		This website (http://kaihatsusha.com) <b>does not</b> collect data in any way, shape or form from users.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		This website (http://kaihatsusha.com) <b>does not</b> track user's web browsing behaviour either on this site, or through tracking cookies on a third-party website.
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Kaihatsu <b>does not, and will never sell your personal data</b> (although none is gathered presently).
	</li>
	
	<li>
		Kaihatsu will happily comply with any data removal requests that have legal standing. Please contact legal[at]kaihatsusha[dot]com if you have any concerns about data or privacy.

	<p><i><small>NOTE: This website uses YouTube's video embedding system to make Kaihatsu videos viewable.

Kaihatsu is not responsible for, and does not have any control over data collected by Google LLC or YouTube LLC on https://youtube.com or any Kaihatsu affiliated channels.

<h2>Usage of Kaihatsu owned videos and Intellectual Property by others.</h2>
<p>
	All content (videos, logos and images) on this website is property of Kaihatsu, and all videos located at http://youtube.com/Kaihatsu (Kaihatsu), https://youtube.com/channel/UCPIaJe6fNsMTe1kOx_euxNg (Kaihatstwo) and https:// youtube.com/channel/UCQFu0RRpCLamRQmxm9I0JWg (36 Views Remastered) are also property of Kaihatsu. Usage of footage from these videos is permitted for critique, commentary and parody, under US fair use copyright law, Fair Dealing in Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 in the United Kingdom, The EU Copyright Directive (Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society), and the Japan copyright act (著作権法). 
</p>
<p>
	Kaihatsu videos are also permitted to be embedded on other websites, such as Reddit, Facebook, twitter.etc, as long as the original video is in its entire length, is fully credited, attributed and linked to youtube.com/Kaihatsu, and as long as the work has not been edited in such a way that alters or impedes the message of the work, or prevents attribution to the original creator.
</p>

<p>
	An exception to altering kaihatsu content, is (certain types of) reaction videos. A reaction video similar in format to that seen on the 'REACT' channel, or reaction videos produced by 'Fine Brothers Entertainment', where only parts of the original work are used to illustrate points and opinions from people reacting to said content, is acceptable and is in compliance with fair use laws. However, creating a 'reaction' video, where the original, full length Kaihatsu content is featured alongside a sedentary person, not considerably contributing/adding to the original work, by speaking over or giving opinion on the original is not permitted, as this is not considered 'fair use' and can constitute as 'freebooting'. Any video (reaction or not) where the original, full length Kaihatsu content can be fully watched and understood without having to watch the original video, is in violation of fair use, and will be met with a cease and desist/DMCA notice/takedown notice from Kaihatsu or a representative of Kaihatsu, and will be followed by legal action if not complied with.
</p>

<p>	
	Kaihatsu requests and requires that for any and all usages of Kaihatsu videos, permission is sought for in writing, by sending an email asking for permission to use Kaihatsu content, to legal[at]kaihatsusha[dot]com or kaihatsu[at]kaihatsusha[dot]com. This also applies to Kaihatsu affiliated channels such as Kaihatstwo and 36 Views Remastered. In the case of the latter, please email 36viewsremastered[at]kaihatsusha[dot]com for permission to use videos from https:// youtube.com/channel/UCQFu0RRpCLamRQmxm9I0JWg. Contact is preferable in English, but is available in Spanish (Español/Castellano) and Japanese (日本語).
</p>
<p>	
	Kaihatsu does NOT give permission to use channel logos, found on this site (Culture Bits logo, The Science Behind Logo, Marxist March Logo, Kaihatsu Theory Logo, Nostalgia Trip Logo) or on any Kaihatsu affiliated channel for anything other than what is acceptable through fair use, and as such, requests to use these will be denied. 
</p>
<p>	
	Kaihatsu also does NOT give permission to use video thumbnails, found on this site (Culture Bits thumbnails, The Science Behind thumbnails, Marxist March thumbnails, Kaihatsu Theory thumbnails, Notalgia Trip Thumbnails) or on any Kaihatsu affiliated channel for anything other than what is acceptable through fair use, and as such, requests to use these will be denied.
</p>
</p>
<p>

Any videos of unofficial Kaihatsu dubs will be met with a cease and desist/DMCA notice/takedown notice from Kaihatsu or a representative of Kaihatsu, and will be followed by legal action if not complied with.  If you wish to seek permission to create a dub of a Kaihatsu video, please email business[at]kaihatsusha[dot]com.
</p>
<p>	
	Attempting to steal Kaihatsu created content by branding it as your own and removing all traces of the original creator (through audio dubbing, video splicing and thumbnail changes) is plagiarism, and channels, individuals or entities that do this will be met with a cease and desist/DMCA notice/takedown notice from Kaihatsu or a representative of Kaihatsu, and will be followed by legal action if not complied with.   
</p>
<p>

<h2>Information regarding collaborations.</h2>
<p>
	Kaihatsu enjoys creating and maintaining stong relationships with other channels and their communities through collaborations. However, the following information must be considered before and during the application process for collaborating:
	
	<li>
	Any set of videos created in tandem as part of a crossover are bound to a 'reciprocal relationship', where both videos or neither should be uploaded. This means that <b>if one video is taken down without a good reason or sufficient notice, the other should also/will also be taken down.</b> This applies to both collaborating channels and Kaihatsu channels.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Kaihatsu reserves the right to ask any collaborator with whom a video has been produced and uploaded on another channel, to take down any content including Kaihatsu. Any past collaborator that wishes to have a collaboration video made by or including themselves taken down from a Kaihatsu channel should email legal[at]kaihatsusha.com, and supply a reason for the request. All requests that are in good standing will be complied with, unless the video features more than one person/collaborator, in which their permission must also be sought. In that case, if more people in that video disagree with the request it does not have to be complied with.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	Kaihatsu may also cut ties with any creator based on violations of YouTube's community guidelines and/or Terms of Service, their own actions as well as association with other creators and their actions, reputation and current standing within the wider YouTube community. This may or may not involve the removal of collaboration videos involving the 2nd party.
	</li>
