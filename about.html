<p>Hey there! I'm Kaihatsu, a British YouTuber who's interested in science, art, culture, history and gaming! I run a YouTube channel where I make 3 main series of videos:

The Science Behind, Culture Bits and Kaihatsu Theory.

In The Science Behind, I usually take one whole game per video and try to explain the different aspects and mechanics of the game using science! Culture Bits is where I look at cultural influences (and references) and other things relating to history in video games. Many of these videos often look at how different artists throughout history have influenced the art direction in games. Kaihatsu theory is the last set of videos for more general theories about games that don't fit into The Science Behind or Culture bits, but there are still many interesting things that have came out of this series (and there will be in the future too!). There's also an event I hold every March called Marxist March, where I try to see if communism has worked it's way into gaming, and also where I make a few conspiracy theories (just for fun!).

I strive to make educational, analytical and fun videos, that can teach us about science, history and the world around us through gaming (or anything else you may suggest to me). </p>
