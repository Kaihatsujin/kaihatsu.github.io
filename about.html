<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Kaihatsu. I am an artist/designer based in the UK who wound up making YouTube videos. I like to make videos about art and culture in video games, but I also tackle other subjects that I enjoy, such as history, science, politics and geography and how they relate to gaming.
</p>

<p>Currently I do YouTube as a hobby, but I am working on a large project that I'm very excited to share with you all! If you are interested in helping fund this project, you can follow the link above to my patreon page.
</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my videos!</p>
