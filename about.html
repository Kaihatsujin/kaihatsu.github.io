<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Kaihatsu. I am an artist/designer based in the UK who wound up making YouTube videos. I like to make videos about art and culture in video games, but I also tackle other subjects that I enjoy, such as history, science, politics and geography and how they relate to gaming.
</p>

<p>Currently I do YouTube as a hobby, but I am working on a large project that I'm very excited to share with you all! If you are interested in helping fund this project, you can follow the link above to my patreon page.
</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my videos!</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<h2>How did you start on YouTube?</h2>
<ol>
<p>I started my first channel back in 2013, but it had limited success. My original channel was mostly about ROM hacking, and was mainly just me talking on my terrible netbook that was my only computer at the time. Later on that year I started messing around with photoshop at school, and gradually taught myself how to use it. However, I was stuck with Movie Maker and Paint for making videos. After only gaining 22 subscribers, I lost motivation and stopped making videos, and made a new channel, which I never uploaded with until I renamed it and made it my second channel, after making my new channel, Kaihatsu.
</p>
<p>My new channel was originally for uploading music remixes that I made, but I started to work on a side project called 'The Science Behind Super Mario Sunshine', while learning how to use Adobe Premiere, as well as other programs from the Creative Cloud Suite. After uploading that first proper video, I knew that I wanted to make more videos like it, and now here we are!

<h2>What programs do you use to make videos?</h2>
<ol>
<p>I use the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, but the main programs I use from that are Photoshop (image editing), Premiere (video editing), After Effects (special effects) and Audition (sound recording). I also use effects suites from Red Giant and some other companies to make my videos look a bit more stylised sometimes.

<p>My microphone is an Audio Technica AT2020USB+ microphone. I also use a microphone stand. For graphics editing I use a Wacom INtuous Pro drawing tablet.
