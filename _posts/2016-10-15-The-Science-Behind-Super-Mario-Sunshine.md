After a long amount of hard work, here it is! The Science behind Super Mario Sunshine! 

The Science behind is a new series on this channel which will explore the science behind our favourite games.

In this episode, we look at if FLUDD's physics add up, the chemical composition of the game's graffiti, and if the magic paintbrush lives up to its name, or if it's explainable with science!
