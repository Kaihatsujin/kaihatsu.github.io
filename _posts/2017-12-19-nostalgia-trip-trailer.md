â–¶â–¶ Kickstarter coming soon!

On the 25th of December, it will have been 10 YEARS since I first picked up a game console - my old DS Lite, and to commemorate this landmark, I want to look back at my experiences as young gamer, living in the Middle-East, as well as from my travels around the globe - I've been fortunate enough to have visited over 25 countries, and experience gaming in many different places, from the coasts of Florida, to the valleys of central Japan - the home of Nintendo!

This series will consist of reviews of (retro-ish?) games and consoles, as well as stories about them from my childhood, as well as some other crazy things that have happened to me - some gaming related, some not!

And, for the first time, I will be live on camera! It may not sound like a big deal considering I've done other 'live' videos before (such as unboxings), but I've never shown my face in a video, and I'm sure that at least a few of you are curious as to what I look like already!

The first episode should be uploaded on the 25th of December (if things go to plan).
