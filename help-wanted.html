<h2>3D Animator & Modeller</h2>

<p>I started my first channel back in 2013 - with limited success. My original channel was mostly about ROM hacking and was mainly just me talking on my terrible netbook that was my only computer at the time. Later on that year I started messing around with photoshop at school and gradually taught myself how to use it. However, I was stuck with Movie Maker and Paint for making videos. After only gaining 22 subscribers, I lost motivation, stopped making videos, and made a new channel which I never uploaded with until I renamed it and made it my second channel, after making my new channel called Kaihatsu.
</p>
<p>My new channel was originally for uploading music remixes that I made, but I started to work on a side project called 'The Science Behind Super Mario Sunshine' while learning how to use Adobe Premiere as well as other programs from the Creative Cloud Suite. After uploading that first proper video, I knew that I wanted to make more videos like it, and now here we are!

<h2>Artists</h2>

<p>I'm always looking to work with other like minded and talented people. Working with others depends on what content they create and how good it is. Because I get a lot of emails asking to collaborate I have some prerequisites for channels that want to work with me. Please see below to check that you're good to go!</p>
	
<p><i><small>Please bear in mind that I can only really consider working with you if you have decent audio and video/editing quality, similar in quality to any of my videos from 2017 onwards.</small></i><p>
